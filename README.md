### So...this is work in progress as I am completely new to GitHub.   So for now have some default text stuff....

- 🖥 I first began developing for IBM's Iseries in RPGLE in '98 and then became a project manager
- 🇺🇸 I took a career break when my family moved to USA and am now learning Python
- 🔭 I’m currently working on a text based RPG game promoting women in tech that was the final project for my introduction to Python course
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all about GitHub and continuing to learn Python
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with creating Discord bots
- 💬 Ask me about Battle Bay - Looking For Trouble discord server 
- 🍺 I love beer, live music, baked goods, kindess & positivity
- 🧠 Apart from coding, my other passion is learning all about mental health: how our brains work and how to help people who are struggling
